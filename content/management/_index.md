- **Co-Founder of two series of international meetings** in logic and computer science:
    1. **CSL** (Computer Science Logic) Conference, the annual conference of the European Association for Computer Science Logic ([EACSL](http://www.eacsl.org/goals.html)), started in 1987. Proceedings published regularly in Springer LNCS.<br/>
    See Egon Boerger: [Ten Years of CSL Conferences](/Curriculum/HistoryCslEacsl87-97.pdf) (1987-1997) in: EATCS Bulletin 63, October 1997, 61-63 (Talk presented to the EACSL 1997 Membership Meeting in Aarhus, August 1997).

    2. **ASM**, the annual workshop on Abstract State Machines, started in 1994. In 2008 merged with the regular meetings of the B and Z User Groups into the series of [ABZ conferences](https://abz-conf.org)).<br/>
    For some of the history see E. Boerger, A. Gargantini and E. Riccobene: [ASM 2003â€”A Double Anniversary in Sicily](/Papers/Miscellaneous/TenYearsAsmWorkshop.pdf). In: Proc. 10th International Workshop on ASMs, LNCS 2589 (2003) pp.1-3.
