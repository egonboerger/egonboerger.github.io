My research area since 1990 is **Software Technology**, where I am interested in rigorous methods and their practical applications for the development and the maintenance of hardware/software systems---with a focus on relating requirements capture by high-level specifications to detailed design and their analysis (both mathematical verification and experimental validation). The main vehicle I use is the ASM Method whose development and industrial applications I have shaped since 1989.

From 1969-1989 I have worked in **Logic and Complexity Theory** - which still influences the way I address the investigation of hw/sw systems.

## Development of the Abstract State Machines (ASM) Method for design and analysis of computer-based systems
- [**AsmBook**](/asmbook): Monograph and Textbook (with electronically available teaching material) on the ASM Method.

  1. [**Goals**](/AsmBook/IntroAsmBook.PDF) of the method: describes the goals of the method and its scientific and practical role as a discipline for the engineering of certifiably reliable systems (Introduction to the [AsmBook](/asmbook)) 

  2. [**Introduction**](/Papers/Methodology/BcsFacs07.pdf) describes the three constituents of the method: machine concept, ground model concept, refinement concept (from a talk to BCS/London)         

  3. ASM [**Ground Model Method**](/Papers/SwEngg/GroundModMethod.pdf) describes in detail the modeling constituent of the ASM method (from LNCS 2772)

  4. ASM [**Refinement Method**](/Papers/Methodology/RefineFACS.pdf) describes in detail the ASM refinement constituent of the ASM method (Formal Aspects of Computing 2003) 

  5. [**Fsm2Asm**](/Papers/Methodology/BcsFacs07.pdf)  defines machine constituent of the method generalizing FiniteStateMachines.  
     A formalized definition can be found in Chapter 2.4 of [AsmBook](/asmbook) and in Chapter 2 of [Jbook](/jbook).
