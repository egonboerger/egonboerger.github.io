<h1 align=center style='text-align:center'>Abstract State Machine Tutorial</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>The method built around the notion of Abstract State Machine
(ASM) has been proved to be a scientifically well founded and an industrially
viable method for the design and analysis of complex systems, which has been applied
successfully to programming languages, protocols, embedded systems,
architectures, requirements engineering, etc. The analysis covers both
verification and validation, using mathematical reasoning (possibly
theorem-prover-verified or model-checked) or experimental simulation (by
running the executable models). The tutorial, presented by <a
href="/">Egon B&ouml;rger</a>, starts from scratch by
introducing the definition and simple examples of ASMs. Their major scientific and
industrial applications are surveyed, covering the period from 1990 to 2000.
Then an outstanding case study is presented, namely the ASM Definition and
Analysis (Verification and Validation)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>of <a href="jbook">Java and the Java Virtual
Machine</a> (book by <a href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~staerk">Robert St&auml;rk</a>,
<a href="http://www.tydo.de">Joachim Schmid</a>, and <a
href="/">Egon B&ouml;rger</a>). The tutorial concludes
with an introduction, presented by Joachim Schmid, of <a
href="http://www.tydo.de/AsmGofer">AsmGofer</a>, an ASM programming system
making ASM models executable by programming the external functions in <a
href="http://www.haskell.org">Haskell</a>. The AsmGofer introduction includes a
demo of the executable versions of the Java/JVM ASM models. </p>

<h3>What are Abstract State Machines</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>The advances in the theory, the tool development, and the
progressive industrial employment of Abstract State Machines (ASMs) in the 90's
have turned ASMs into a <b>practical technique for disciplined rigorous system
engineering</b> in the large. See <a href="http://www.eecs/umich.edu/gasm">www.eecs.umich.edu/gasm</a>
for the hundreds of papers published on ASMs and their applications, covering
high-level design and analysis of real-life programming languages and their
implementations on virtual or real machines (e.g. Java/JVM, C, VHDL, SDL), of
protocols (e.g. Kermit, Kerberos), embedded system control programs,
architectures (RISC processors, PVM, APE, ASIC components), requirements
capture, etc.</p>

<p>Although the definition of ASMs is surprisingly simple (see below), Abstract
State Machines offer a certain number of theoretically well-founded and
industrially useful methods that <b>support the entire software development
cycle.</b> These include rigorous modelling and analysis methods (both
mathematical verification and experimental validation) for</p>

<h3>Definition of Abstract State Machines (<span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt;font-weight:normal'>Yuri Gurevich 1988</span>) </h3>

<p>A sequential ASM is defined as a set of transition rules of form </p>

<pre><span>&nbsp; </span><b>if</b> Condition <b>then</b> Updates</pre>

<p style='tab-stops:45.8pt 91.6pt 137.4pt 183.2pt 229.0pt 274.8pt 320.6pt 366.4pt 412.2pt 458.0pt 503.8pt 549.6pt 595.4pt 641.2pt 687.0pt 732.8pt'>which
transform first-order structures (the states of the machine), where the guard <i>Condition</i>,
which has to be satisfied for a rule to be applicable, is a variable free
first-order formula, and <i>Updates</i> is a finite set of function updates
(containing only variable free terms) of form </p>

<pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>f (t1,...,tn) := t</pre>

<p style='tab-stops:45.8pt 91.6pt 137.4pt 183.2pt 229.0pt 274.8pt 320.6pt 366.4pt 412.2pt 458.0pt 503.8pt 549.6pt 595.4pt 641.2pt 687.0pt 732.8pt'>The
execution of these rules is understood as updating, in the given state and in
the indicated way, the value of the function <i>f</i> at the indicated
parameters, leaving everything else unchanged. (This proviso avoids the frame problem
of declarative approaches.) In every state, all the rules which are applicable
are simultaneously applied (if the updates are consistent) to produce the next
state. If desired or useful, declarative features can be built into an ASM by
integrity constraints and by assumptions on the state, on the environment, and
on the applicability of rules.</p>

<p style='tab-stops:45.8pt 91.6pt 137.4pt 183.2pt 229.0pt 274.8pt 320.6pt 366.4pt 412.2pt 458.0pt 503.8pt 549.6pt 595.4pt 641.2pt 687.0pt 732.8pt'>For
distributed ASMs, the notion of run, which is defined for sequential systems as
sequence of computation steps of a single agent, is replaced by the notion of a
partial order of moves of finitely many agents, such that the following three
conditions are satisfied: (i) co-finiteness: each move has only finitely many
predecessors, (ii) sequentiality of single agents: the moves of every agent are
linearly ordered, (iii) coherence: each finite initial segment <i>X</i>
corresponds to a state <i>s(X)</i>, interpreted as the result of executing all
moves in <i>X</i>, which for every maximal element <i>x</i> of <i>X</i> is
obtainable by applying move <i>x</i> in state <i>s(X-{x})</i>. The moves of the
single agents can be atomic or durative, but for simplicity the preceding
definition of distributed runs assumes actions to be atomic.</p>

<p style='tab-stops:45.8pt 91.6pt 137.4pt 183.2pt 229.0pt 274.8pt 320.6pt 366.4pt 412.2pt 458.0pt 503.8pt 549.6pt 595.4pt 641.2pt 687.0pt 732.8pt'>This
definition of distributed ASMs, which are also called multi-agent ASMs, provides
a theoretical basis for a coherent global system view for concurrent sequential
computations of single agents, each executing its own sequential ASM, at its
own pace and with atomic actions applied in its own local states, including
input from the environment as monitored functions. The definition guarantees
that given any finite initial segment of a distributed run, all linearizations
of this segment, also called interleavings, yield the same global view of the
state resulting from the computation. In other words, if moves of different
agents are independent of each other in a given run, they can be scheduled
relatively to each other in an arbitrary manner, without influencing the
overall view of the state resulting from the run.</p>

<p style='tab-stops:45.8pt 91.6pt 137.4pt 183.2pt 229.0pt 274.8pt 320.6pt 366.4pt 412.2pt 458.0pt 503.8pt 549.6pt 595.4pt 641.2pt 687.0pt 732.8pt'>The
notion of distributed ASM runs comes with no recipe for constructing such runs,
which in applications may turn out to be a challenging problem. However, it is
this generality of the concept that provides the freedom to design and analyse
models for distributed systems without any a priori commitment to special
synchronization or communication concepts, an important consequence for the
practice of modelling. This includes the abstraction from any particular
conditions on the timing of moves of the single agents. The ordering of moves
reflects only their causal dependency, which is a before-after-relation without
further details on the precise timing of the moves.</p>

  <p class=MsoNormal>AsmGofer is an advanced Abstract State Machine programming
  system. It is an extension of the functional programming language Gofer which
  is very similar to <a href="http://www.haskell.org">Haskell</a>. In the
  AsmGofer introduction we take the well known <i>Game of Life</i> example and
  make it executable in AsmGofer. This implies defining the static and dynamic
  semantics. Furthermore we show, how AsmGofer can automatically generate a
  graphical user interface (GUI) and finally we define a customized GUI in
  AsmGofer for the game (see the screenshot on the right side).</p>

are now going to describe the dynamic behavior of the game in terms of Abstract
State Machines. This means that we formulate the above three rules in ASMs. The
first of them is implicitly established by the ASMs semantics, because the
state changes only if explicitly specified. The second rule (<i>Death</i>)
corresponds to the following ASM rule <i>letDie</i> which takes two parameters,
namely <i>cell</i> and <i>n</i>. The argument <i>n</i> is the number of alive
neighbors and <i>status</i> is a unary dynamic function to store denote whether
a cell is alive or dead. </p>

to the <i>letDie</i> rule, we can translate the <i>Birth</i> rule into an ASM
