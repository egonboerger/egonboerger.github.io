        <a href="http://www.springer.de/cgi-bin/search_book.pl?isbn=3-540-42088-6">Java and the Java Virtual Machine
          &#8212; Definition, Verification, Validation</A><p>
The book provides a high-level description, together with a mathematical
and an experimental analysis, of Java and of the Java Virtual Machine
(JVM), including a standard compiler of Java programs to JVM code and
the security critical bytecode verifier component of the JVM. The
description is structured into language layers and machine components.
It comes with a natural executable refinement (written in 
<a href="http://www.tydo.de/AsmGofer/">AsmGofer</a> and
provided on CD-ROM) which can be used for testing code. The method
developed for this purpose, using 
<a href="http://www.eecs.umich.edu/gasm/">Abstract State Machines</a>
(ASMs), can be applied to other virtual machines and to other 
programming languages as well.<p>
The Jbook <i>gives the most comprehensive and consistent formal
account of the combination of Java and the JVM</i>.
(Pieter Hartel and Luc Moreau in 
<a href="http://www.ub.utwente.nl/webdocs/ctit/1/00000050.pdf">Formalizing
the Safety of Java, the Java Virtual Machine and Java Card</a>,
ACM Computing Surveys, 33(4):517-558, 2001. Section 6.2, page 540.)<p>
The target readers are practitioners&#8212;programmers, implementors,
standardizers, lecturers, students&#8212;who need for their work a complete,
and at the same time transparent definition, and an executable model, of
the language, and of the virtual machine underlying its intended
implementation.

<h3>Some highlights of Jbook</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>Definition</dt>
     <dd><a href="download/nutshell.pdf">Java and the JVM in a Nutshell</A>
         lists 
         the main rules and functions which constitute the ASM 
         models of Java and the JVM. These rules appear in the
         appendix of Jbook.</dd>
  <dt>Verification<dt>
   <dd>We analyse and prove the following fundamental property of JVM
       verification and execution of compiled Java programs:<p>
       <i>
       Under explicitly stated conditions, any well-formed and well-typed 
       Java program, when correctly compiled, 
       passes the verifier and is executed on the JVM. It executes 
       without violating any run-time checks, and is correct with 
       respect to the expected behavior as defined by the Java machine.</i>
       <p>
       The proof for this fundamental property uses several other 
       theorems. Some of them are described on
       <a href="highlights/proofs.html">this</a> page.
       </dd>
  <dt>Validation</dt>
    <dd>The book comes with an electronic version on CD-ROM which 
        includes the executable versions of the models, with examples 
        and exercises described in the book. It comes with a
        setup program <a href="download/Jbook-1.04.exe">Jbook-1.04.exe</a>
        for Microsoft Windows based platforms and 
        <a href="download/machines-1.04.tar.gz">precompiled binaries</a>
        for Linux, Solaris Sparc, and cygwin under
        Microsoft Windows. In addition 
        <a href="download/AsmGofer.tar.gz">AsmGofer.tar.gz</a> contains  
        the source code of <a href="http://www.tydo.de/AsmGofer/">AsmGofer</a>,
        which is the tool used to execute the
        models in the book. You will need the sources only in case you have to
        compile your own binary of AsmGofer. The setup program 
        <a href="download/Jbook-1.04.exe">Jbook-1.04.exe</a> already contains the 
        binary for Microsoft Windows.
