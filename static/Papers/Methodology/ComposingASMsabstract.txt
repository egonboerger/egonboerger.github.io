Composition and Submachine Concepts for Sequential ASMs

Three composition and structuring concepts are presented which reflect
frequently used refinements of ASMs and integrate standard structuring
constructs into the global state based parallel ASM view of
computations.  First we provide an operator which combines the atomic
update view of ASMs with sequential machine execution and naturally
incorporates iteration constructs into ASMs. For structuring large
machines we define their parameterization, leading to a notion of
possibly recursive submachine calls which sticks to the bare logical
minimum needed for sequential (non distributed) ASMs, namely
consistency of simultaneous machine operations. For encapsulation and
state hiding we provide ASMs with local state, return values and error
handling.

Some of these structuring constructs have been implemented by Joachim
Schmid in ASMGofer. We provide also a proof-theoretic definition which
supports the use of common structured proof principles for proving
properties for complex machines in terms of properties of their
components.
