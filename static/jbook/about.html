About Jbook
</H1>
The book <b>Java and the Java Virtual Machine - Definition, 
Verification, Validation</b> provides a high-level description, 
together with a mathematical
and an experimental analysis, of Java and of the Java Virtual Machine
(JVM), including a standard compiler of Java programs to JVM code and
the security critical bytecode verifier component of the JVM. The
description is structured into language layers and machine components.
It comes with a natural executable refinement (written in 
<a href="http://www.tydo.de/AsmGofer/">AsmGofer</a> and
provided on CD-ROM) which can be used for testing code. The method
developed for this purpose, using 
<a href="http://www.eecs.umich.edu/gasm/">Abstract State Machines</a>
(ASMs), can be applied to other virtual machines and to other 
programming languages as well.<p>

The target readers are practitioners&#8212;programmers, implementors,
standardizers, lecturers, students&#8212;who need for their work a complete,
correct, and at the same time transparent definition, and an executable
model, of the language, and of the virtual machine underlying its intended
implementation. As a consequence, in our abstract and stepwise refined
models for the language and the machine, we first of all try to directly and
faithfully reflect, in a complete way, as far as possible without becoming
inconsistent, and in an unambiguous yet for the human reader graspable way,
the intuitions and design decisions which are expressed in the reference
manuals and underly the current implementations of the language and of the
machine. The rigorous framework we provide allows us to clarify some dark
corners in the manuals and newly discovered bugs in the implementations.
Since our framework is implementation independent, it can also be used for
the specification and evaluation of variations or extensions of the language
and of the virtual machine, and for the mathematical and the experimental
study and comparison of present and future Java implementations. In
particular, our componentwise specifications of Java and the JVM are
amenable to mathematical and computer-assisted verification as well as to
the experimental validation of practically important properties of Java
programs when executed on the JVM. E.g., the analysis in the Jbook brings to
light in what sense, and under which conditions, legal Java programs can be
guaranteed to be correctly compiled, to successfully pass the bytecode
verifier, and to be executed on the JVM correctly, i.e. faithfully
reflecting the Java semantics and without violating any run-time checks
(Main Theorem).<p>

The diagram below illustrates  how the three parts of the Jbook are
connected to piecemeal establish that result. In Part I we define the
semantics for Java programs, in Part II we define how they are compiled into
Virtual Machine programs and how the obtained bytecode is executed on the
<i>trustfulVM</i>, shown to faithfully reflect 
the Java semantics. In Part III we
extend this machine to a <i>defensiveVM</i> which at 
run-time guards the trustful
execution of every instruction by an appropriate type (etc.) correctness
check. This check function is used to define a correct notion of bytecode
type assignment, i.e. one which provably prevents type violations at
run-time and admits a type assignment for each compiled Java program. Then
we define how to propagate checked type assignments to single instructions,
thus obtaining our verifier <i>verifyVM</i> which we can show 
to compute a bytecode
type assignment if there is one.  The combination of the 
<i>trustfulVM</i> and the
<i>verifyVM</i> in the <i>diligentVM</i> establishes the 
Main Theorem. The 
<a href="download/introduction.pdf">introduction</a>
and the 
<a href="download/contents.pdf">contents</a>, and of course 
the Jbook, provide more detailed explanations.<p>
