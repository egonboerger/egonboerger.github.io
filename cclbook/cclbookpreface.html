DEDICATION
<br> <br> This book is dedicated to
         <ul><li> Donatella Barnocchi </a><br><br></li>
              <li> Dieter Roedding (*24.8. 1937, +4.6. 1984)</a><br><br></li>
         </ul>
<br>
To both of them I owe more than this book - its
beginning, its being completed and the best of its
contents. I owe them, in particular, their example:
it consists in confronting persons and situations in
life and science selflessly and with an open mind,
and never abandoning the purpose of recognising what
is essential and true and to think and act
accordingly.
<br>

<br> <br>

PREFACE

<br> <br>
The theme of this book is a pair of concepts, already
recognised as belonging together by Leibniz, whose
mathematical development from Frege to Turing has laid the
theoretical foundation of computer science: the concept of
formal language as carrier of the precise expression of
meaning, facts, problems, and the concept of algorithm or
calculus, that is, formally operating procedure for the
solution of precisely described questions and problems. The
book gives a unified introduction to the modern theory of
these concepts, to the way in which they developed first in
mathematical logic and computability theory and later in
automata theory, the theory of formal languages and complexity
theory. Apart from considering the fundamental themes, and
nowadays classical aspects of these areas, the subject matter
has been selected to give priority throughout to the new
aspects of traditional questions, results and methods which
have developed from the needs or knowledge of computer science
and particularly of complexity theory.
<br> <br>
The aim of this book is twofold: to be a textbook for
introductory courses in the above-mentioned disciplines as
they occur in almost all current curricula of computer
science, logic and mathematics, but apart from this, to be a
monograph in which further results of new research (to a large
extent in textbook form for the first time) are systematically
presented and where the attempt is made to make explicit the
connections and analogies between a variety of concepts and
constructions. A price must be paid by the reader for the
knowledge I expect him to acquire when and if the experiment
is successful: for the beginner the first lectures of the text
will be difficult due to the profusion of concepts, remarks
and forward and backward references to currently posed
clusters of problems particularly if he approaches the
material by self-study unaccompanied by lectures. My advice
is to initially skip over those parts which, despite study,
are not understood; the connections will spring to mind on
second reading.
<br> <br>
The following remarks on the use of the book might be
helpful; I have employed all parts of this book as the basis
of introductory or advanced lectures on the foundations of
theoretical computer science, automata theory and formal
language, logic, computability- and complexity-theory. To
enable the reader to recognise the use and interdependence of
the various parts I have devised a detailed table of contents
and a graph of interdependence. The sections marked with *
contain material which is not treated in the basic courses but
is suitable to follow them.
<br> <br>
The arrangement of propositions as theorem, lemma, remark
and exercise mirrors the methodical significance of the
various states of affairs from a contemporary point of view.
It says nothing about historical or individual achievements
to have proved these propositions for the first time. Many a
significant proposition becomes a simple example as a result
of later progress.
<br> <br>
I strongly recommend beginners to work out with pencil and
paper, at first reading, all matters of routine or
intermediate steps which are not explained in detail and to
solve the exercises, or at least, try to solve them. By doing
this one not only learns whether one has really understood the
preceding subject matter and how to apply it, but one also
acquires a feeling for what is essential in the techniques
used. In this endeavour it might help that I have tried to
express complicated ideas occurring in proofs without the use
of formulas. The reader is advised to use this method of
intuitive, but precise substantive thinking which opens the
way to a deeper understanding.
<br> <br>
The references to literature at the end of each section are
considered as completions or those references given in the
text.
<br> <br>
I would like to express my heart-felt thanks to the many
persons who have helped with the work on this book in the past
years, by no means all of whom I am able to mention. I name
in particular the following colleagues and collaborators who
read the manuscript in whole or in part and who have given me
valuable criticisms: K. Ambos-Spies, H. Braemik, t. Brand,
A. Brueggemann, H. Fleischhack, J. Flum, G. Hensel, H. Kleine
Buening, U. Loewen, L. Mancini, K. May, W. Roedding,
H. Schwichtenberg, D. Spreen, J. Stoltefub, R. Verbeek, S. Wainer.
<br> <br>
Separately I would like to thank: K.Ambos-Spies, whose
elaboration of one of my Dortmund logic lectures I have
partially used in chapters D/E, and who has given valuable
help, particularly to BII3; U. Loewen for a critical reading of
the entire manuscript and the preparation of the symbol- and
subject-indices; K.May for careful corrections and numerous
drawings; H.W.Roedding for the intricate control of the
bibliography.
<br> <br>
I would especially like to thank U. Minning, R. Kuehn,
J. Kossmann, P. Schoppe and K. Grulich for the precise
transposition of parts of several versions of my manuscript
into the type-script for the printer. U. Minning has borne the
main burden in this - her engaging and friendly manner has
often allowed me to forget this arduous labour.
<br> <br>
Finally, but not less heartily, I thank Walburga Roedding
and many other colleagues who, in the past difficult six
weeks, have given me their spontaneous moral support, thereby
decisively helping me to complete this book.

<br> <br>

Note on the second edition. At this point I would like to
express heartfelt thanks to M.Kummer, P. Paeppinghaus,
V. Sperschneider: mainly because of their list of errors
corrections have been made in the second edition. At this
point also I thank ln advance all those readers who show me         
further errors.
